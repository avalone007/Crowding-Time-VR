## Data
Data contains the participants responses to questions and surveys, cardiac data collected using the E4 wristband, and time logs of start and end of each trip (to align with cardiac data).

### E4
Cardiac data recorded by E4 wristband

### time logs
Start and end timestamp of trips to be aligned with cardiac data

### qualtrics
Participants responses recorded using Qualtrics online platform

## Analysis

### analyze -> setup
Reading the data and preparation for analysis. Trip data are stored in a dataframe called *df_all*, and subject data are stored in a dataframe named *df_subj*

### analyze -> main
Statistical tests
